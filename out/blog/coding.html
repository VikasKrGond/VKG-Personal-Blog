<p>My very first interaction with the computer is at very tender age when I have just reached the third standard we had a PC then with windows XP the very first thing that I did with it is play purble places and a pinball game.
In 2010 I got my personal internet connection and my mind was just blown to know the powers of the Internet and the miracle it can do. So I clearly remember what I did on internet first actually I am a movie and song freak so at that year Dabangg was released and with no time I searched Dabangg songs it took around 10 seconds to load and I clicked the Youtube Link and from there I searched multiple songs of Honey Singh and KK at that time but within no time I got a popup message that I reached to 100% of data(2GB monthly was my pack with Rs.199 of Idea. Igot scolded from my elder sister about that but It was fun.
Now in 2012, In my 6th standard first time, I came to know about HTML in our bi-weekly computer class. Web page is again something which stuck in my mind after class over our school ended but I didn&#39;t leave the lab because I found something interesting, So I just started searching more on HTML on Internet thankfully our teacher didn&#39;t mind but our school has two shifts second shift started and their 2nd period was Computer lab all of a sudden noise of students filled the lab then only I realized that it&#39;s more than 2 hours since my chutti Ijused snatched my bag and rushed to home. From that day onwards in every computer class, I used to stay in the lab for at least an hour after school. This thing continued till my teacher stopped me from staying in the lab after lab but that time I already made at least 70-100 random web pages thinking that I&#39;m the next Bill Gates.
I just did this kind of random stuff till the 10th at that time Udacity was just launched and they are providing an Android course and some others, I just enrolled in at least a dozen of courses which are free at time and just started watching videos like videos of Android without even knowing what Android is or what Java is I just used to watch these or believe it or not I completed all of these course videos within 1 month and the mont was February the time when all other are preparing for boards I think I was the only one who&#39;s doing such crazy things.

Now after the board exam in 2017, I reached class 11th and for the first time we have Computer Science as a core subject but It&#39;ll be given to students who gave 10CGPA in 10th must be sharp enough in Maths(I&#39;ve both ) and I entered in class 11th I was super duper excited to attend the CS class by Paritosh Sir (We call him Parii Sir) . I don&#39;t know why but He started the CS with Algorithm and Flowchart (Chapter-6) I didn&#39;t understand anything in class for the first time in my entire life an this happened for a Week and I&#39;m not the only one who&#39;s witnessing this nightmare around 20 students out of 54 left the CS and opted Hindi I was thinking the same but I counseled this thing with my elder sister first and she knows my crazy for Computer and then I just took a trial of at least 10-15 coaching classes who are teaching C++ for +2 from there for the first time Icame across about TurboC++ and DevC++ and coding I absolutely fell in Love with the Coding at that Day which continues till date.

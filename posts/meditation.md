1. What meditation meant to me.
2. How I conquered the biggest disease.
3. My Two ways of performing meditation.

Our brain is the most advanced and the most worked part of the body and yet we barely care about this asses. In this blog, I'll talk about what mediation means for me. If you're following my blogs then you know that a Day Dreamer I used to Imagine a lot for the constructive cause obviously so in this whole process sometimes I overload my brain and In that case, my meditation strategy helps me a lot to rejuvenate myself for next such brain intensive storming deeds. Actually, I used to perform meditation in two ways my first way is to go to the uttermost silent place where I can clearly hear my heartbeats and breathing sound I used to perform this whenever I've internal conflict because in my case no one from external can hinder my peace. In other words, I can say I conquered the very dangerous disease **Sabse bada rog kya kahenge log** a very long ago, So no matter people what talked about me I've never got angry, frustrated but however I'm not nullifying those suggestions at the same time. Actually, I figured out an empirical formula for that and that is whenever and whatever people say I observed that 90% of that is entirely garbage and out of the remaining 10%, hardly 1-2% is constructive one and needs some attention and brainstorming and that is what exactly I used to do just before my sleep because at that time there is a sudden transfer of brainpower from conscious to the subconscious mind and that is the perfect time to find that unanswered comment from the most powerful part of the brain.

 My second and the most frequent way of meditating is by singing whenver I felt tired or overworked I used to sing some intense deeply layered song which I like the most like: 
**Kun faya kun, Arziyan, Labh par aye, Main Rhoon Ya na Rhoon, Humari Adhuri Kahani, Ayat ,  Ijazat, Zindgi Do pal ki, Sajda, Shiv Tandav Shrot**
 e.t.c. these songs instantly act as a medicine for me and I can deep dive in my work again. So these are my ways of meditaing, Please share your ways of meditation as well with me. Thanks for Being Patient and Reading till the end :)

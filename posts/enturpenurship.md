**Enturpenurship** this word is solely very powerful and it changed my way of thinking forever. I'll start from my childhood from my initial day's I'm always like a problem-solving guy (Don't worry I'm not talking about the Maths Problem).I just love to find the solution to any problem and for that what I used to do a lot is imagination because I don't know there is something magical happens to me whenever I'm trying to think for a problem in spite of seeing the problem of other's I used to make it my problem try to understand the pain, the discomfort that a particular person undergoes when they faced the same problem and I'm a firm believer that before you wanted to solve a problem you must a lived that problem and from their one must collect the motivation. I clearly remember that in games period when all other students used to play I always entered the field with the thought that I'll get the opportunity to talk with my seniors(I was in class 5-6th and Senior of class 10,11 and 12th) with them I used to talk on problems and it's possibble solution whatever we can find with our intelligence level these problems imclude the Polluion, Literacy ,Opportunities in Demonitisaton,Political refroms learning from the Past and from western world, technology and the changing world with Internet and I know how desparately I used to wait for these Games Period sometimes I used to bunk the classes of irrerlavent subjects for me Like Arts,Music(at that time),Yoga Vocational Courses,Extra periods of English,Hindi and SST and afer escaping I used to wait there and be their alone just thinkig and talkig to myself(that is what Ifollow thill that time) In 2016-17 all my seniors were passed out and Now I've begun my new ride of Internet and Computer (Which I talked in my First Blog) and what I did is I acutally converted my affair with Enturpenurship and my Love of Computers into a unvreakable reltionship with is at new milestone in each passing day. Now a day's I used to dedicate at least 30% of my time to thinking about the solution, Upskilling myself for better leadership skills better understanding of the market, and the present changing Geo-Political scenario as well as the technical advancement. I used to travel a lot and there is a popular saying in Chinese that **You can learn more than a book just by traveling a mile.** and I'm witnessing this on daily basis. Thanks for reading my Blog :), Please give your Feedback I'll definitely try to work on it. I'm leaving with my all-time favorite quote and it's by on and only **Stev Jobs**
